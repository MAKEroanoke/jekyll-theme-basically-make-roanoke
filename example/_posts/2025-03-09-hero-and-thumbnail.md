This post should display a large hero image at the top of a page.

This post tests a horizontal image using the following YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
image:
    path: /assets/images/eder-oliveira-180877.jpg
    thumbnail: /assets/images/eder-oliveira-180877.jpg
```

Hero images can also be assigned like this:

```yaml
image: /assets/images/eder-oliveira-180877.jpg
